<h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css/"target="_blank"title="description of JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
     (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS,
     is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based,
     multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.<br>
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core
      technologies of World Wide Web content production.
      It is used to make webpages interactive and provide
      online programs, including video games. The majority
      of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support
       it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in
       JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines
       represent a different implementation of JavaScript,
       all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some
        engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many
        engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the
standard markup langauge for
<strong>creating <u>web</u>
pages</strong> and web applications.<br>Web
browsers receive HTML documents from a
web server or from local storage and
render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">HTML elements are the building blocks
of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects, such as
interactive forms,<br> may be embedded into
the rendered page. It provides a means
to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics<br> for text
such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
links, quotes and other items. HTML
elements are delineated by tags,
written using angle brackets.</p>-->
