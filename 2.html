<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the
standard markup langauge for
<strong>creating <u>web</u>
pages</strong> and web applications.<br>Web
browsers receive HTML documents from a
web server or from local storage and
render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">HTML elements are the building blocks
of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects, such as
interactive forms,<br> may be embedded into
the rendered page. It provides a means
to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics<br> for text
such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
links, quotes and other items. HTML
elements are delineated by tags,
written using angle brackets.</p>-->
